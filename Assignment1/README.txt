This is the documentation for project1 of COMP4021

I used the names of NBA players as the input data, there are in total 44 players.

For the current roasters, they are categorized by the team they are playing for.
And for the hall of famers or retired player, they are not categorized.

Input any single character can trigger the query to do the autocomplete,
it's recommended to input 'c' to check all the features.

Since there are capital letters in the names, the capital letter may also match the lower case letter, however, they will 
not be in color blue.

For example, if you type k
It will have "The Great Kobe Bryant" as a autocomplete option, however, the "K" in "Kobe" will not be blue.
i.e. Only the exact match of characters will be in the color blue.
