This whole game is developed under the CHROME browser.

There are 9 good things in total, the number 9 will not change for each level.
There are 6 monsters in the first level, and it will add up by 4 in the following level.
C to cheat on, V to cheat off, K to kill all the monsters (usually just for faster testing).

Note that there is a time interval between two transmitting through the portals.
Also, there is also a shooting interval.

The animation for the monsters are scaling, I try to make it looks like "breathing" lol.
And be careful that the flipping of monsters are not transparent, but they are flipped when walking left or right.
