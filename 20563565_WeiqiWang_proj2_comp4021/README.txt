This whole game is developed under the CHROME browser.

There are 9 good things in total, the number 9 will not change for each level.
There are 6 monsters in the first level, and it will add up by 4 in the following level.
C to cheat on, V to cheat off, K to kill all the monsters (usually just for faster testing).

To be honest, there are still bug that may not be perfect.
Such as, the bullet shoot from the purple monster can't kill the player.
Aside from this, I haven't discover any other bugs.
